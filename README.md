DriverPass Reflection

The project was concerned with the design of a system for the driving school, which requires an online platform for training, organizational matters of schedules, financial transactions, as well as practice exams. The client requires an entire system that enables students to book classes with tutors, complete tests online, as well as make payments.

I think I did especially well with the system diagrams. Each one shows how the parts of the system connect and flow together, and I made sure they clearly match the client’s goals from the interview. The diagrams ended up looking clean and easy to follow, which was important for showing my understanding of how the system should work.

If I could go back and do one section differently, it would be the technical requirements section. I would make it a little more specific about the servers and the databases so it would sound more like it was from a real plan. It would make it sound more professional.

As far as the needs of the user, I concentrated on what was clear from the interview. The client indicated that it was important for everything to be online, simple, and efficient. This was translated into the design by including all functions available from a secure online interface. Paying attention to the needs of the users is significant since if the system doesn’t make sense from the users’ perspective, then it’s not an efficient system regardless of its effectiveness.

For future designs of software, I will continue focusing on using diagrams effectively as a means of staying organized. Also, from this project experience, it is clear how important it is to consider both the technological as well as the user perspective. This will ensure that the design solves problems that users face.
